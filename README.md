# Calculator
Created a simple calculator app using Android studio in Java. It is just an implementation of basic knowledge.
This project contains 2 files:
1. MainActivity.java file: This is where the logic for the application is coded. 
2. activity_main.xml file: This is where the designing part of the application is done. 

These files are created by default with the required methods and imports when you create a project on Android Studio.
